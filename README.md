## DS 310 Project Team 06

In this project, we analyzed COVID-19 data to understand how different government policies affect virus spread. We built a data pipeline to process this data and use tools like GitHub and Power BI for managing and visualizing the information. Our goal was to help the leaders of a Caladan, determine which minimal restrictions can effectively keep the growth of new cases and deaths below 3% and 1%, respectively. We came up with the results, embraced in a presentation and a report that outline the most effective policies based on the analysis.
